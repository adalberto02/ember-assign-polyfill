This is a super simple polyfill for enabling support for `Ember.assign` in Ember <= 2.4. I found on several occasions I needed to shim this, so decided to just put together an addon for it.

### Installation

```bash
ember install ember-assign-polyfill
```

### Usage

```js
import assign from 'ember-assign-polyfill';
```
